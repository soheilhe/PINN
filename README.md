# PINN

The integration of physics with machine learning, aiming to bridge the gap between data-driven and physics-based approaches, develops diverse methodologies, referred to as physics-informed or -guided machine learning methods.
Thee physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) refer to a method that integrates the physics law as a penalization term into the loss function, introduced by Raissi et al. (2019), which used in this model.
In this model, DeepXDE library with a Tensorflow backend was utilized. 
The goal of this study is to model the transverse displacement of the beam from integration of physics knowledge and the boundary conditions and sensory data to make a seamless integration between observed data and the model. Euler-Bernoulli beam equation was chosen as the underlying physics equation.
